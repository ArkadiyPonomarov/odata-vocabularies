This instance annotation has the format of a [message body](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.01/odata-json-format-v4.01.html#sec_MessageBody) and may be server-side expanded with a navigation property that is annotated with [`UI.UserInteraction`](UI.md#UserInteraction) or with an instance annotation [`UI.UserInteractionSimple`](UI.md#UserInteractionSimple). Overall, the error response can contain multiple such navigation properties or instance annotations.
