A conflict detected by an OData server leads to a response that is somewhere between success and error.
        This vocabulary offers terms for exposing such conflicts in error responses in a structured manner.

[userInteraction](ConflictResponse.xml#L40)|Untyped|<a name="userInteraction"></a>Response payload embedded into an error response and including data for user interaction<br>The embedded response payload describes a conflict that was detected by the server and that requires user interaction to be resolved before the request can be successfully repeated. It has the format of a [message body](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.01/odata-json-format-v4.01.html#sec_MessageBody) and is server-side expanded with a navigation property that is annotated with [`UI.UserInteraction`](UI.md#UserInteraction) or with an instance annotation [`UI.UserInteractionSimple`](UI.md#UserInteractionSimple). Overall, the error response can contain multiple such navigation properties or `UI.UserInteractionSimple` annotations.
