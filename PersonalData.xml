## Definition

Personal Data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

## TODO

- "ConsentDependentData" is data that needs to be deleted if a consent is withdrawn -> to be discussed with Bjoern Dederichs whether we need this


## Background Info

"Order" or other contract-like thing is a stronger "Legal Ground" than a "Consent"

Legal grounds may be part of the "primary" micro-service or just referenced from another 

"Marketing Campaign" is a legal ground that is itself justified by a "Consent"



## Open Issues

### Missing annotations on fields

Annotation | Question
-----------|---------
sap:pdm-semantics="legal-entity" | ???
sap:pdm-legal-entity-key="sales-org" | "Usually legal entities are propagated to the application via OAuth token attributes this annotation provides the name of the attribute" - this is rather technical and relying on a specific authentication mechanism and a specific implementation and creates a technical dependency of the service and the currently used identity provider. Also: the OAuth token would contain the legal entity of the authenticated user, whereas the data would contain the legal entity of a data subject (customer, employee, ...) that is represented by that data record - why should these match except in very special cases?
sap:pdm-display-seq-no="-1" | ???
sap:pdm-semantics="user-profile-id" | Still needed? See question below on UserProfileID
sap:pdm-semantics="consent-purpose-id" | ???
sap:pdm-semantics="consent-purpose-name" | ???
sap:pdm-semantics="consent-type" | ???
sap:pdm-semantics="consent-valid-from"  | ???
sap:pdm-semantics="consent-valid-to" | ???
sap:pdm-semantics="consent-status" | ???


### Tagging of contact-related fields as "personal data"

- Is it really necessary to tag contact-related fields as "personal data"? Can a firstname, lastname, or birthdate ever be "non-personal data"?

### Address-related fields        

Field | Question
------|---------
address-district | Not part of vCard: why is this needed? Usually the district isn't part of an address
address-care-of-name | c/o: not part of vCard: why needed?
address-building | Not part of vCard: why is this needed?
